# App Description
In this app, I've used [Zomato-API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) with [React.js](https://reactjs.org) to fetch the restaurants present in a particular location. <br> You'll able to get the details like **average cost for two people**, **price ranges**, **rating**, **has online delivery or not**, and **cuisines** of that location.
